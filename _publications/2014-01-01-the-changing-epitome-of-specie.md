excerpt: 'The discipline taxonomy (the science of naming and classifying organisms, the original bioinformatics and a basis for all biology) is fundamentally important in ensuring the quality of life of future human generation on the earth; yet over the past few decades, the teaching and research funding in taxonomy have declined because of its classical way of practice which lead the discipline many a times to a subject of opinion, and this ultimately gave birth to several problems and challenges, and therefore the taxonomist became an endangered race in the era of genomics. Now taxonomy suddenly became fashionable again due to revolutionary approaches in taxonomy called {DNA} barcoding (a novel technology to provide rapid, accurate, and automated species identifications using short orthologous {DNA} sequences). In {DNA} barcoding, complete data set can be obtained from a single specimen irrespective to morphological or life stage characters. The core idea of {DNA} barcoding is based on the fact that the highly conserved stretches of {DNA}, either coding or non coding regions, vary at very minor degree during the evolution within the species. Sequences suggested to be useful in {DNA} barcoding include cytoplasmic mitochondrial {DNA} (e.g. cox1) and chloroplast {DNA} (e.g. {rbcL}, {trnL}-F, {matK}, {ndhF}, and {atpB} {rbcL}), and nuclear {DNA} ({ITS}, and house keeping genes e.g. gapdh). The plant {DNA} barcoding is now transitioning the epitome of species identification; and thus, ultimately helping in the molecularization of taxonomy, a need of the hour. The ‘{DNA} barcodes’ show promise in providing a practical, standardized, species-level identification tool that can be used for biodiversity assessment, life history and ecological studies, forensic analysis, and many more.'

The discipline taxonomy (the science of naming and classifying organisms, the original bioinformatics and a basis for all biology) is fundamentally important in ensuring the quality of life of future human generation on the earth; yet over the past few decades, the teaching and research funding in taxonomy have declined because of its classical way of practice which lead the discipline many a times to a subject of opinion, and this ultimately gave birth to several problems and challenges, and therefore the taxonomist became an endangered race in the era of genomics. Now taxonomy suddenly became fashionable again due to revolutionary approaches in taxonomy called {DNA} barcoding (a novel technology to provide rapid, accurate, and automated species identifications using short orthologous {DNA} sequences). In {DNA} barcoding, complete data set can be obtained from a single specimen irrespective to morphological or life stage characters. The core idea of {DNA} barcoding is based on the fact that the highly conserved stretches of {DNA}, either coding or non coding regions, vary at very minor degree during the evolution within the species.
