excerpt: 'As part of a wider project to assess the impact of ultrasound on in vitro plant growth, this paper aimed to determine whether the application of piezoelectric ultrasound ({PE}-{US}) would induce changes to the transcriptome of in vitro potato (Solanum tuberosum L.). After exposing explants (single-node segments with a single leaf) to {PE}-{US} (35 {kHz}; 70 W) for 20 min, the effect of this stressor was determined at 0 h, 24 h, 48 h, 1 week, and 4 weeks to assess the possible immediate and residual effects of {PE}-{US} on the potato transcriptome. After {mRNA} was isolated, bioinformatic processing and analysis of {RNA}-seq datasets, {KEGG} analysis revealed that 24\% of up-regulated biological processes were a response to stress immediately after the application of {PE}-{US} (reducing to 11\% and 9\% at 48 h and 4 weeks, respectively). After assessing a total of 40,430 genes for expression intensity at these five time intervals, it was found that 138, 72, 18, 5, and 59 differentially expressed genes ({DEGs}), respectively, were significantly up-regulated, while 6, 82, 96, 172, and 107 {DEGs}, respectively, were down-regulated. {DEGs} coding for universal stress protein, chitinase, catalase, zinc finger proteins, 21 transcription factors, glutathione S-transferase, and 17 heat shock proteins, mainly Hsp70, Hsp20, and Hsp90 proteins, and possibly the first of such discovery in {US}-based plant stress research, was detected. Following the validation of {RNA}-seq data by {RT}-{qPCR}, between {SeqMonk} {LFC} and {RT}-{qPCR} {LFC}, the Spearman and Pearson correlation coefficients were 0.86 and 0.90, respectively. Plantlets exposed to {PE}-{US} had significantly shorter shoots but significantly longer roots as well as higher shoot and root fresh weight, while chl b and total chl were significantly lower but the chl a/b ratio was significantly higher in plantlets exposed to {PE}-{US}. {PE}-{US} thus constituted an acute abiotic stress, but by 4 weeks, in vitro potato plantlets managed to mitigate the stress through the production of antioxidant enzyme systems and other functional metabolic changes.'

As part of a wider project to assess the impact of ultrasound on in vitro plant growth, this paper aimed to determine whether the application of piezoelectric ultrasound ({PE}-{US}) would induce changes to the transcriptome of in vitro potato (Solanum tuberosum L.). After exposing explants (single-node segments with a single leaf) to {PE}-{US} (35 {kHz}; 70 W) for 20 min, the effect of this stressor was determined at 0 h, 24 h, 48 h, 1 week, and 4 weeks to assess the possible immediate and residual effects of {PE}-{US} on the potato transcriptome.
