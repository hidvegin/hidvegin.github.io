excerpt: 'In response to an ultrasound pulse, several hundred {DEGs}, including in response to stress, were up- or down-regulated in in vitro potato plantlets. Despite this abiotic stress, plantlets survived. Ultrasound ({US}) can influence plant growth and development. To better understand the genetic mechanism underlying the physiological response of potato to {US}, single-node segments of four-week-old in vitro plantlets were subjected to {US} at 35 {kHz} for 20 min. Following {mRNA} purification, 10 {cDNA} libraries were assessed by {RNA}-seq. Significantly differentially expressed genes ({DEGs}) were categorized by gene ontology or Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes identifiers. The expression intensity of 40,430 genes was studied. Several hundred {DEGs} associated with biosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism and catabolism, cellular protein modification, and response to stress, and which were expressed mainly in the extracellular region, nucleus, and plasma membrane, were either up- or down-regulated in response to {US}. {RT}-{qPCR} was used to validate {RNA}-seq data of 10 highly up- or down-regulated {DEGs}, and both Spearman and Pearson correlations between {SeqMonk} {LFC} and {RT}-{qPCR} {LFC} were highly positive (0.97). This study examines how some processes evolved over time (0 h, 24 h, 48 h, 1 week and 4 weeks) after an abiotic stress ({US}) was imposed on in vitro potato explants, and provides clues to the temporal dynamics in {DEG}-based enzyme functions in response to this stress. Despite this abiotic stress, plantlets survived.'

In response to an ultrasound pulse, several hundred {DEGs}, including in response to stress, were up- or down-regulated in in vitro potato plantlets. Despite this abiotic stress, plantlets survived. Ultrasound ({US}) can influence plant growth and development. To better understand the genetic mechanism underlying the physiological response of potato to {US}, single-node segments of four-week-old in vitro plantlets were subjected to {US} at 35 {kHz} for 20 min. Following {mRNA} purification, 10 {cDNA} libraries were assessed by {RNA}-seq. Significantly differentially expressed genes ({DEGs}) were categorized by gene ontology or Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes identifiers. The expression intensity of 40,430 genes was studied. Several hundred {DEGs} associated with biosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism and catabolism, cellular protein modification, and response to stress, and which were expressed mainly in the extracellular region, nucleus, and plasma membrane, were either up- or down-regulated in response to {US}. {RT}-{qPCR} was used to validate {RNA}-seq data of 10 highly up- or down-regulated {DEGs}, and both Spearman and Pearson correlations between {SeqMonk} {LFC} and {RT}-{qPCR} {LFC} were highly positive (0.97). This study examines how some processes evolved over time (0 h, 24 h, 48 h, 1 week and 4 weeks) after an abiotic stress ({US}) was imposed on in vitro potato explants, and provides clues to the temporal dynamics in {DEG}-based enzyme functions in response to this stress. Despite this abiotic stress, plantlets survived.
