excerpt: '{DNA} methylation is a process of epigenetic modification that can alter the functionality of a genome. Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, this study quantify the level of {DNA} methylation in the epigenomes of two diploid apple (Malus x domestica) scion cultivars (’{McIntosh}’ and ’Húsvéti rozmaring’) derived from three environmental conditions: in vivo mother plants in an orchard, in vitro culture, and acclimatized in vitro plants. The global {DNA} methylation levels were not dependent on the source of plant material, and the average level of {DNA} methylation was 49.77\%, 34.65\% and 8.77\% in {CpG}, {CHG} and {CHH} contexts, respectively. Significant differences in {DNA} methylation were identified in 586 (specifically 334, 201 and 131 in {CpG}, {CHG} and {CHH} contexts, respectively) out of 45,116 genes, including promoter and coding sequences. These were classified as differentially methylated genes ({DMGs}). This is a 1.3\% difference in the level of {DNA} methylation of genes in response to a change in the environment. Differential methylation was visualised by {MA} plots and functional genomic maps were established for biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components. When the {DMGs} were considered, in vitro tissue culture resulted in the highest level of methylation, but it was lower in acclimatized in vitro plants which was similar to that in the mother tree. Methylation patterns of the two scions differed, indicating cultivar-specific epigenetic regulation of gene expression during adaptation to various environments. After selecting genes that displayed differences larger than ±10\% in {CpG} and {CHG} contexts, or larger than ±1.35\% in the {CHH} context from among the {DMGs}, they were annotated in Blast2 {GO} v5.1.12 for Gene Ontology. {DMGs} identified as {MD}07G1113000 (protein transport), {MD}08G1041600 (extracellular space), {MD}09G1054800 (phosphatidic acid binding), and {MD}10G1265800 (not annotated) were methylated in all three contexts in in vitro shoots. These {DNA} methylation results suggest that epigenetic changes may contribute to the adaptation of apple to environmental changes by modifying the epigenome and thereby gene expression.'

{DNA} methylation is a process of epigenetic modification that can alter the functionality of a genome. Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, this study quantify the level of {DNA} methylation in the epigenomes of two diploid apple (Malus x domestica) scion cultivars (’{McIntosh}’ and ’Húsvéti rozmaring’) derived from three environmental conditions: in vivo mother plants in an orchard, in vitro culture, and acclimatized in vitro plants. The global {DNA} methylation levels were not dependent on the source of plant material, and the average level of {DNA} methylation was 49.77\%, 34.65\% and 8.77\% in {CpG}, {CHG} and {CHH} contexts, respectively. Significant differences in {DNA} methylation were identified in 586 (specifically 334, 201 and 131 in {CpG}, {CHG} and {CHH} contexts, respectively) out of 45,116 genes, including promoter and coding sequences. These were classified as differentially methylated genes ({DMGs}). This is a 1.3\% difference in the level of {DNA} methylation of genes in response to a change in the environment.
