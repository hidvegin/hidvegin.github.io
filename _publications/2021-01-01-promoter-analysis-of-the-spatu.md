excerpt: 'The aim of this study was to identify transcription factor ({TF}) binding sites and cis-regulatory elements ({CREs}) on the promoters of {FvSPR}1-like2 ({SPIRAL}) and {FvSPT} ({SPATULA}) genes in the woodland diploid strawberry (Fragaria vesca L.). We identified: (1) {MYB}59, {WRKY}25 and {WRKY}8 {TFs} which play a role in ethylene signaling; (2) {ARF} family of {TFs} which play a role in {ARF}-mediated auxin signaling on the promoter of {FvSPR}1-like2 gene; (3) {ARR} family of {TFs} which play a role in cytokinin signaling; (4) {ERF} family of {TFs} which play a role in ethylene signaling on the promoter of {FvSPT}. This bioinformatic analysis of {TFs} and {CREs} may provide a better understanding of the function of genes involved in, and the mechanism underlying, non-climateric ripening during strawberry fruit maturation.'

The aim of this study was to identify transcription factor ({TF}) binding sites and cis-regulatory elements ({CREs}) on the promoters of {FvSPR}1-like2 ({SPIRAL}) and {FvSPT} ({SPATULA}) genes in the woodland diploid strawberry (Fragaria vesca L.). We identified: (1) {MYB}59, {WRKY}25 and {WRKY}8 {TFs} which play a role in ethylene signaling; (2) {ARF} family of {TFs} which play a role in {ARF}-mediated auxin signaling on the promoter of {FvSPR}1-like2 gene; (3) {ARR} family of {TFs} which play a role in cytokinin signaling; (4) {ERF} family of {TFs} which play a role in ethylene signaling on the promoter of {FvSPT}. This bioinformatic analysis of {TFs} and {CREs} may provide a better understanding of the function of genes involved in, and the mechanism underlying, non-climateric ripening during strawberry fruit maturation.
