excerpt: 'Despite countless papers on plant tissue culture, few have assessed the transcriptional changes that occur in a developing explant from the moment it is cut and plated, and during early stages of development. In this study, the {mRNA} profile of in vitro potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) plantlets derived from internode stems was assessed via four comparisons during five time intervals (0 h, 24 h, 48 h, 1 week, and 4 weeks) using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ({KEGG}) classification. After screening {KEGG} metabolic groups, 35 processes were shown to be either up- or down-regulated. The vast majority (28 processes) were related to growth or development. The expression intensity of 40,430 genes was assessed and 158, 107, 163, and 142 sequences were either significantly up- or down-regulated at 0 h vs 24 h, 24 h vs 48 h, 48 h vs 1 week, and 1 week vs 4 weeks, respectively. A total of 10 {DEGs} coding for transcription factors were significantly down-regulated, including five ethylene-responsive transcription factors, and two probable {WRKY} transcription factors. {RT}-{qPCR} was used to validate {RNA}-seq data: Spearman and Pearson correlation coefficients between {SeqMonk} {LFC} and {RT}-{qPCR} {LFC} were 0.748 and 0.879, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first transcriptomic assessment of the changes taking place in the {mRNA} profile of a developing potato stem explant.'

Despite countless papers on plant tissue culture, few have assessed the transcriptional changes that occur in a developing explant from the moment it is cut and plated, and during early stages of development. In this study, the {mRNA} profile of in vitro potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) plantlets derived from internode stems was assessed via four comparisons during five time intervals (0 h, 24 h, 48 h, 1 week, and 4 weeks) using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ({KEGG}) classification. After screening {KEGG} metabolic groups, 35 processes were shown to be either up- or down-regulated. The vast majority (28 processes) were related to growth or development. The expression intensity of 40,430 genes was assessed and 158, 107, 163, and 142 sequences were either significantly up- or down-regulated at 0 h vs 24 h, 24 h vs 48 h, 48 h vs 1 week, and 1 week vs 4 weeks, respectively. A total of 10 {DEGs} coding for transcription factors were significantly down-regulated, including five ethylene-responsive transcription factors, and two probable {WRKY} transcription factors. {RT}-{qPCR} was used to validate {RNA}-seq data: Spearman and Pearson correlation coefficients between {SeqMonk} {LFC} and {RT}-{qPCR} {LFC} were 0.748 and 0.879, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first transcriptomic assessment of the changes taking place in the {mRNA} profile of a developing potato stem explant.
