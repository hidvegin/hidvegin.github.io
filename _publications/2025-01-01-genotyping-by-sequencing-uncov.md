excerpt: '{GBS} read coverage analysis identified a Robertsonian chromosome from {twoThinopyrumsubgenomes} in wheat, conferring leaf and stripe rust resistance, drought tolerance, and maintaining yield stability. Agropyron glael ({GLAEL}), a Thinopyrum intermedium × Th. ponticum hybrid, serves as a valuable genetic resource for wheat improvement. Despite its potential, limited knowledge of its chromosome structure and homoeologous relationships with hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum) has restricted the full exploitation of {GLAEL}’s genetic diversity in breeding programs. Here, we present the development of a 44-chromosome wheat/{GLAEL} addition line ({GLA}7). Multicolor genomic in situ hybridization identified one chromosome arm from the St subgenome of Th. intermedium, while the other arm remained unclassified. Genotyping-by-sequencing ({GBS}) read coverage analysis revealed a unique Robertsonian translocation between two distinct Thinopyrum subgenomes, identified as 4StS·1JvsS. The {GLA}7 line demonstrated strong adult plant resistance to both leaf rust and stripe rust under natural and artificial infection conditions. Automated phenotyping of shoot morphological parameters together with leaf relative water content and yield components showed that the {GLA}7 line exhibited elevated drought tolerance compared to parental wheat genotypes. Three years of field trials showed that {GLA}7 exhibits similar agronomic performance and yield components to the wheat parents. This unique addition line holds promise for enhancing wheat’s tolerance to multiple stresses through the introduction of new resistance genes, as well as its ability to mitigate the effects of temporary water limitation during flowering, all without negatively impacting wheat performance.'

{GBS} read coverage analysis identified a Robertsonian chromosome from {twoThinopyrumsubgenomes} in wheat, conferring leaf and stripe rust resistance, drought tolerance, and maintaining yield stability. Agropyron glael ({GLAEL}), a Thinopyrum intermedium × Th. ponticum hybrid, serves as a valuable genetic resource for wheat improvement. Despite its potential, limited knowledge of its chromosome structure and homoeologous relationships with hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum) has restricted the full exploitation of {GLAEL}’s genetic diversity in breeding programs. Here, we present the development of a 44-chromosome wheat/{GLAEL} addition line ({GLA}7). Multicolor genomic in situ hybridization identified one chromosome arm from the St subgenome of Th. intermedium, while the other arm remained unclassified. Genotyping-by-sequencing ({GBS}) read coverage analysis revealed a unique Robertsonian translocation between two distinct Thinopyrum subgenomes, identified as 4StS·1JvsS.
