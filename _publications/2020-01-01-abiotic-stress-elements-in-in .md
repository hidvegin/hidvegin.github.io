excerpt: 'Ultrasound ({US}) can modify the plant growth and development. Previous assessments of the transcriptome of in vitro potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) exposed to {US} transmitted through air ({AB}-{US}) or liquid ({PE}-{US}) revealed the up- or down-regulation of several stress-related differentially expressed genes ({DEGs}) related to abiotic stress. In a bid to better characterize stress-related elements over a four-week period, the transcriptome of {AB}-{US} was compared to that of {PE}-{US}. When comparing the controls of both treatments, {DEGs} related to hypoxia were not detected. Nevertheless, hypoxia-related {DEGs} were detected in the combination of liquid medium and ultrasonication. {DEGs} coding for chitinase, peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase, transcription factors of {ERF} (ethylene responsive factor), {DREB} (dehydration-responsive element-binding), {WRKY} and {MYB} were also significantly highly expressed in {PE}-{US}, relative to {AB}-{US}. Up- and down-regulation of {DEGs} related to metabolic processes, and enzymes of the antioxidant system also confirm that {PE}-{US} is a more acute abiotic stress than {AB}-{US}. Key message A transcriptomic analysis revealed that liquid-based ultrasonication was a stronger abiotic stressor than air-based ultrasonication. Of particular interest were the heat shock proteins and transcription factors in this comparison. Despite the ultrasound stress, explants survived and plantlets developed.'

Ultrasound ({US}) can modify the plant growth and development. Previous assessments of the transcriptome of in vitro potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) exposed to {US} transmitted through air ({AB}-{US}) or liquid ({PE}-{US}) revealed the up- or down-regulation of several stress-related differentially expressed genes ({DEGs}) related to abiotic stress. In a bid to better characterize stress-related elements over a four-week period, the transcriptome of {AB}-{US} was compared to that of {PE}-{US}. When comparing the controls of both treatments, {DEGs} related to hypoxia were not detected. Nevertheless, hypoxia-related {DEGs} were detected in the combination of liquid medium and ultrasonication. {DEGs} coding for chitinase, peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase, transcription factors of {ERF} (ethylene responsive factor), {DREB} (dehydration-responsive element-binding), {WRKY} and {MYB} were also significantly highly expressed in {PE}-{US}, relative to {AB}-{US}. Up- and down-regulation of {DEGs} related to metabolic processes, and enzymes of the antioxidant system also confirm that {PE}-{US} is a more acute abiotic stress than {AB}-{US}. Key message A transcriptomic analysis revealed that liquid-based ultrasonication was a stronger abiotic stressor than air-based ultrasonication.
